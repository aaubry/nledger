.SYNOPSIS
    Installs or uninstall NLedger binaries on any platform (Windows, Linux, OSX).
.DESCRIPTION
    Installing NLedger is an optional operation that may improve it's usability.
    It performs three basic actions:
      1) Adds the path to NLedger binaries to PATH variable so that you can call in any folder;
      2) Creates an alias (hard link) 'ledger' to 'NLedger-cli.exe' to let you use a typical name;
      3) For .Net Framework, it calls NGen to create a very efficient native image for NLedger binaries that
         dramatically improves performance. Note: this action requires administrative privileges.
    If no switches are specified, this script can play a role of an interactive console where the user
    can enter available commands and check the result status. Available commands are shown when the script is run.
.PARAMETER install
    Installs NLedger binaries. If there are binaries for both platforms (.Net Framework and .Net Core), prefers .Net Framework,
.PARAMETER installPreferCore
    Installs NLedger binaries but prefers .Net Core binaries if there is a choice.
.PARAMETER uninstall
    Uninstalls NLedger (removes from PATH, deletes 'ledger' alias and deletes NGen image for .Net Framework)
.EXAMPLE
    C:\PS> .\NLedger.Install.ps1
    Runs the script as an interactive console. Help script is shown and the user can enter commands.
.EXAMPLE
    C:\PS> .\NLedger.Install.ps1 -uninstall
    Uninstalls NLedger from the system.
